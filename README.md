'computational model' for pivot studies 

## what does 'being able to change' change ? 

*pivotModelXIV*

1. More variations in organization structures   
  * bottom up vs. top down pivot 
    * CEO decide what to do & managers decide how to do 
    * Managers find something worth doing -> CEO incorporate into firm strategy 
  * new business is supervised by whom
    * Incorporate into existing business -> more relevant department / random / department with capacity redundancy 
    * Independent 
    * Directly supervised by CEO 
  * across time  
    * A similar perspective as Pentland 2020 ?   

## how firms get aware of the need to change 

*pivotModelXV* 

1. Coupled decision set would stagnate pivot because firms cannot identify which part is wrong -> Minimum Viable Product 
2. But the ultimate product is a coupled system -> there is global-local tradeoff -> in an incremental way. 
  * In orthodox "search" theory, incremental search is likely to be sub-optimal. But in systematic experiments (e.g., large scale AB test), would agents still get trapped by local optima? 
    * at least, it's going to be more exhaustive than experiential. 
    * there seems to be a width vs. depth tradeoff between exhaustive and experiential search. One is the tradeoff in search process, namely DFS vs. BFS. The other is the tradeoff in feedback. If feedback is with uncertainty, we could search broadly with more uncertainty or search narrowly with less uncertainty. 
3. startups can search in an incremental way. What about incumbents? What if startups are searching in a dynamic environment (i.e., past element set would no longer be valuable). This question relates to strategic exit. 
  * periodical trim?
