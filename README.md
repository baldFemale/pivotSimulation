'computational model' for pivot studies 

## what does 'being able to change' change ? 

*pivotModelXIV*

1. More variations in organization structures   
  * bottom up vs. top down pivot 
    * CEO decide what to do & managers decide how to do 
    * Managers find something worth doing -> CEO incorporate into firm strategy 
  * new business is supervised by whom
    * Incorporate into existing business -> more relevant department / random / department with capacity redundancy 
    * Independent 
    * Directly supervised by CEO 
  * across time  
    * A similar perspective as Pentland 2020 ?
